because_handlebars
==================

I built a boilerplate thing because handlebars.

Normally, I do a lot of maintenance, and, historically would not have chosen to use handlebars in a project; this is an excercise in actually starting a project using handlebars.

If you like, use this as a starting point, or use it as a reference for starting your own backbone/handlebars project. It will definitely save you the pain/suffering of setting one up yourself.

Getting Started
==================

Edit posts.json to add your blog posts. Use markup. Escape quotes.

```
because_handlbars> npm install
because_handlbars> bower install
```

Results
=================

Start a server

```
because_handlbars> node server.js
```

[open in your browser](http://localhost:1337)

Compiled Templates
==================
